iRobot Data Visualization using Javascript & D3.js.

This data visualization plots the Mission Data per Country (Number of Robots, Number of Missions & The Number of Missing Missions) against eachother, in order to tease apart and better understand the relationship between each of these three variables. 

Both the X & Y axes are interactive, such that when a different axes is clicked, the data dynmically updates to reflect the chosen X & Y axes.
